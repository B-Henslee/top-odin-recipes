This project will show what I learned creating links.

AAR: This project was a refresher since ive done this before. This was a great lesson though because it helped me learn hotkeys for VSCode that I hadn't known previously. I learned Alt+Click will make multiple cursors to select with and change the hotkey for emmet: wrap with abbreviations to increase workflow speed.
